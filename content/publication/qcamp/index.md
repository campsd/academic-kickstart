abstract: The 2024 Quantum Computing, Math and Physics Camp (QCaMP) for Students was a 4-week long summer camp aimed at introducing high school students to quantum concepts and careers, including applications spanning quantum computing, sensing, and communication. The program ran for 7 hours/day, Monday-Friday, July 1-26, and included hands-on modules and activities, professional development, and project-based learning. Here we provide details on the camp curriculum and outcomes based on pre and post knowledge and attitudes assessments.
