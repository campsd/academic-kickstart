abstract: "The matrix eigenvalue problem is often encountered in scientific computing
applications. Although it has an uncomplicated problem formulation, the best
numerical algorithms devised to solve it are far from obvious.
In my PhD we generalize methods of QR-type, the standard class of
algorithms to solve the eigenvalue problem, to rational QR methods.
This generalization uses a pole swapping technique. We show that
the convergence behaviour of this new class of algorithms is governed
by rational functions and that they are both more accurate and more efficient
than existing methods."
