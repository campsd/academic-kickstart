abstract: Pole-swapping algorithms, which are generalizations of the QZ algorithm for the generalized eigenvalue problem, are studied. A new modular (and therefore more flexible) convergence theory that applies to all pole-swapping algorithms is developed. A key component of all such algorithms is a procedure that swaps two adjacent eigenvalues in a triangular pencil. An improved swapping routine is developed, and its superiority over existing methods is demonstrated by a backward error analysis and numerical tests. The modularity of the new convergence theory and the generality of the pole-swapping approach shed new light on bi-directional chasing algorithms, optimally packed shifts, and bulge pencils, and allow the design of novel algorithms.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: This article studies a convergence theory applicable to all pole-swapping methods. It proposes a backward stable algorithm to compute a pole swap in finite precision.
