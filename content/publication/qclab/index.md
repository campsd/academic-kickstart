abstract: We introduce QCLAB, an object-oriented MATLAB toolbox for constructing, representing, and simulating quantum circuits. Designed with an emphasis on numerical stability, efficiency, and performance, QCLAB provides a reliable platform for prototyping and testing quantum algorithms. For advanced performance needs, QCLAB++ serves as a complementary C++ package optimized for GPU-accelerated quantum circuit simulations. Together, QCLAB and QCLAB++ form a comprehensive toolkit, balancing the simplicity of MATLAB scripting with the computational power of GPU acceleration. This paper serves as an introduction to the package and its features along with a hands-on tutorial that invites researchers to explore its capabilities right away.
