[Daan Camps](https://www.nersc.gov/about/nersc-staff/advanced-technologies-group/daan-camps/) is a staff member in the [Advanced Technologies Group](https://www.nersc.gov/about/nersc-staff/advanced-technologies-group/) at the [National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC)](https://www.nersc.gov/) at [Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory](https://www.lbl.gov). He is interested in exploring the interface between classical HPC systems and emerging quantum computing technology.

Prior to joining NERSC, Daan was a postdoctoral researcher in the Scalable Solvers Group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. He has completed projects on [quantum compilation, quantum chemistry, and machine learning for nonlinear tensor factorizations](#publications). Daan developed and contributed to multiple open source [software packages](#software).

He holds a PhD in Computer Science from KU Leuven where he introduced
*pole swapping* algorithms for eigenvalue problems.
