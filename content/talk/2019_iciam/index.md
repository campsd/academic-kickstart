summary: Talk on the multishift, multipole rational QZ algorithm presented at ICIAM 2019 Conference in Valencia, Spain.
abstract: " We present a multishift, multipole rational QZ iteration for
block Hessenberg pencils in this talk. We show that its convergence
behavior is governed by rational functions. The aggressive early
deflation strategy is incorporated in the algorithm and we pay special
attention to the numerical stability of the pole swaps. Numerical
experiments exemplify the competitiveness and accuracy of the
resulting methods. This is joint work with Raf Vandebril and Karl
Meerbergen."
