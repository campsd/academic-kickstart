summary: Presentation for Public PhD Defence at KU Leuven.
abstract: "The matrix eigenvalue problem is often encountered in scientific computing applications. Although it has an uncomplicated problem formulation, the best numerical algorithms devised to solve it are far from obvious. Computing all eigenvalues of a small to medium-sized matrix is nowadays a routine task for an algorithm of implicit QR-type using a bulge chasing technique. In this work we generalize bulge chasing algorithms to pole swapping algorithms. We show that the convergence of pole swapping methods is determined by rational functions and that they can outperform existing methods."
