summary: Talk on FunFact presented at ICIAM 2023 Conference in Tokyo, Japan.
abstract: "FunFact simplifies the design of matrix and tensor factorization algorithms. It features a powerful programming interface that augments the NumPy API with Einstein notations for writing concise tensor expressions. Given an arbitrary forward calculation scheme, the package will solve the inverse problem using stochastic gradient descent, automatic differentiation, and multi-replica vectorization. It is GPU- and parallelization-ready thanks to modern numerical linear algebra backends such as JAX/TensorFlow and PyTorch. We demonstrate a variety of use cases."
