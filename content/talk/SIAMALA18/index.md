summary: Abstract and slides for SIAM-ALA 2018 presentation.
abstract: "The multishift $QZ$ method by Moler & Stewart implicitly applies subspace iteration driven by a polynomial. We have generalized this to the $RQZ$ method, operating on two Hessenberg matrices, and employing subspace iteration driven by a rational function. This is done implicitly without computing matrix inverses.
In this talk we introduce the $RQZ$ method and explore some possibilities to utilize pole selection as an additional degree of freedom."
